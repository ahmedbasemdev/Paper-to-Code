# ALexNet

AlexNet is a deep convolutional neural network, which was initially developed by Alex Krizhevsky and his colleagues back in 2012. It was designed to classify images for the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 competition where it achieved state of the art results. You can read in detail about the model in the original research paper [Here](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf).
